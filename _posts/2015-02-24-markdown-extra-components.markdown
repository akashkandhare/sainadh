## Summary:

Now a day’s cyber security is one of the challenge area in 2017 from late 90’s there are many methods and techniques we follow to secure our Networks but still we failed to provide 100% security.
Why?
Because when a new software or website is hosted on internet the hacker identify
a bug/loophole/vulnerability in application then the hacker develops the tool for exploiting that bug and grabs the all sensitive information form the that company. Any application which is connected to the internet is NOT SECURE AND IT IS VULNERABLE to various attacks.
why this is happen even we install firewalls and IDS into our Environment still attacks like wanna cry is happen every year effected millions of the computer? because of the OUR BLIND PROGRAMS
WE WRITE A PROGRAMS WITHOUT INTELLIGENCE not believing with me? let us take a context
There is a windows login screen we have different types of users like admin,moderator,local users each user have a different roles and rights which is nothing but permissions we all know that admin has a full permissions and moderator has a less permissions than the admin we can assume as medium level permission and local users have a low level permission that is low level have a limited resources. now we have a windows login screen the user who is trying to login as admin but he is NOT ADMIN he types various passwords for example he trying 20 password attempts to login into admin account finally he logged and dump all the sql database he TASK IS COMPLETE. now does firewall and IDS and windows identify any malicious activity? NO because windows login screen back end program only checks for admin and the corresponding password if admin and corresponding password is correct then the user happily logged into the system do what he wants to do. not only windows login screen there are every application which work similarly to this. WE FAILED TO IDENTIFY MALICIOUS ACTIVITY IN OUR NETWORK.
The next generation of cyber security using AI and machine learning
Programs are not so secure as we think. writing a million of code is a time waste and we don’t give 100% assure that the millions of code is secure even also we spend lots of time in it. as we now Machine learning is a present research area which is using in a present technologies example google uses a speech recognition by using the deep learning algorithm in machine learning. machine learning is nothing but machine that learn as humans think. we give input and output to the machine the machine will give the program that is what machine learning is. 
consider the above context we all now that is malicious activity because admin now his password but why he tries 20 different passwords? and why he immediately dump all the sql database? traditional programs only check if and else statement in our program if admin==password then he can login and do whatever it may be these leads to an insecurity in our organizations our traditional programs works like a MAN, WITHOUT BRAIN. by using machine learning algorithms, we can add intelligence to our programs and we can identify these types of malicious activity before leads to a bigger attack. By using machine learning in cyber security area, we can stop future attacks.
Thanks for reading…
